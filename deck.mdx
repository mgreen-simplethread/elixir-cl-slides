# About Elixir

---

export default Split

![Elixir Logo](./images/elixir.png)

+ Runs on the Erlang VM
+ Started as a research project by Jos√© Valim
+ Syntax influenced by Ruby, programming paradigm more similar to Erlang or Clojure
+ Provides a friendlier syntax for developing massively concurrent, fault tolerant apps

# On the Shoulders of Giants

# Erlang Features

+ Functional
+ Distributed
+ Immutable data
+ Pattern matching
+ Applications are "Write once, run forever" - Joe Armstrong
+ Open Telecom Platform built into the standard library

---

# WTF is OTP?

Basically the Erlang ecosystem and runtime:

+ Compiler
+ Debugger
+ Observer for running apps
+ Process manager
+ Distributed DB and key/value storage services
+ SNMP interface
+ Cooperative process scheduler
+ Test runner
+ Coverage analyzer

---

# Notable Uses

+ Telecommunications (Ericsson, probably everyone else too)
+ Banking, Finance, Real-time trading (Goldman Sachs)
+ Instant messaging (ejabberd, WhatsApp)
+ Spam prevention at Pinterest
